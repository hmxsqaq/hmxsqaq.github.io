I served as the sole programmer on this project, responsible for writing all the code using the Unity engine.

## Background

As the shadow of war engulfs Europe, the Führer's ambition for domination grows boundless. The Empire is locked in a fierce battle, where every decision could tip the scales between victory and annihilation. In these dark times, the Führer has summoned you—one of the Empire’s most brilliant weapons engineers. Your mission is to craft the deadliest missiles with unparalleled precision, capable of obliterating enemy cities with minimal resources.

But this is no ordinary task. The Empire’s resources are rapidly dwindling, and the Führer demands nothing less than perfection. He has entrusted you with the power to alter the course of history, but any misstep could mean the end of everything.

The fate of the Empire—and your own survival—rests in your hands.

## Game Overview

In this puzzle game, you take on the role of a scientist tasked with designing a nuclear bomb. Your objective is to replicate the target blast zone provided by the Führer using the fewest resources possible. You will combine and modify basic shapes—like triangles and squares—using operations such as layering, rotation, and scaling. Once your design is complete, you press the launch button, holding the fate of millions in your hands.

## How to Play

Players select a basic shape and then apply various components to modify it. The system works like a pipeline: each slot in the sequence modifies the output from the slot to its left. The final result is displayed in the rightmost slot.

Your goal is to use these components to perfectly match the target blast zone shape.
