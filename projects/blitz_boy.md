## About the Game

Picture a Beijing winter! You walk from the freezing cold into a warm room, take off your heavy winter coat, and go to high-five your roommate—ZAP! A jolt of static electricity shocks you both. That's a truly memorable kind of TOUCH.

In our game, we tried to recreate this common life experience. The protagonist must TOUCH others to build up a static charge, and then TOUCH different people to shock them.

TOUCH is both the means and the end.

We hope everyone can enjoy this memorably shocking "TOUCH"!
