## About the Game

Bored? Then come blow up some balloons!

This is a very simple balloon inflation simulator. All you have to do is press and hold the screen to inflate the balloon! The frequency of the balloon's shaking will hint at when it's about to pop. We haven't set any rules for the game itself.

Designed as a party game "prop," players are free to create their own rules. You can take turns inflating the balloon, with the person who makes it pop losing, or you can add more complex rules like turn timers and precision-based scoring. The most important thing is just to enjoy the moment! o(≧v≦)o
