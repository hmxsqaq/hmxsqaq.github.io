## About the Game

This Game Jam was centered around the theme "Absorb." We chose a **minimalist design style**, making "sucking" the sole gameplay mechanic. 

We intentionally minimized superfluous visual elements, instead providing rich feedback through abundant sound effects and dynamic animations to offer players a unique and focused experience.
