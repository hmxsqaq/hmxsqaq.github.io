## About the Game

This is a simple yet serious simulation game about navigating the world as a visually impaired person. One player takes on the role of the blind individual, while the other plays as the guide dog. Without a physical leash connecting them, can the person place their complete trust in the dog's guidance? And can the dog successfully lead its owner down the correct path? The final outcome rests solely on the actions and trust between the two players.

Player feedback like, "I'm sweating buckets," "Is it really this difficult?" and "This is terrifying," highlights the game's impact. It's only when you are plunged into darkness that you can begin to grasp the profound sense of helplessness. The challenges we face for a few minutes in this game are a lifelong reality for the visually impaired. We hope this experience encourages everyone to show more respect and consideration, starting with simple but crucial actions like keeping sidewalks for the blind unobstructed.
