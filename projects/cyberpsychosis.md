## Game Overview

*Cyberpsychosis* is a cooperative Sokoban-style puzzle game developed by five freshman students from the Communication University of China.

The theme of this Game Jam was "Harmonious Frankenstein." Our creative approach was to take a classic, simple game mechanic and introduce small tweaks and innovations. The game's story is set in a cyberpunk world where humans undergo extensive cybernetic augmentation while striving to maintain their humanity and avoid "cyberpsychosis." We felt this balance between humanity and machine perfectly matched the competition's theme, which led us to the game's title.

The protagonist is a young woman who requires cybernetic implants after a car accident. Post-surgery, her medical report indicates a high probability of developing bipolar disorder due to immune rejection. However, her family cannot afford the expensive immunosuppressants. Following her doctor's advice, she undergoes a unique therapy: controlling two split versions of her consciousness (representing mania and depression) in a virtual game. By making them cooperate to complete objectives, she trains herself to find mental balance.

The in-game backgrounds, character portraits, and BGM were all generated by AI. (Our game designer and artist were successfully tamed by the AI!)
