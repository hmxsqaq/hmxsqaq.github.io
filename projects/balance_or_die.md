# Balance or Die

I served as a programmer and designer on this project.

## About the Game

> Harmonize everything, balance everything.
>
> An endless stream of bizarre objects rains from the sky, and you have only a single balance scale.
>
> Catch them. Balance them.
>
> Survive!

## Design Philosophy

Visually, *Balance or Die* embraces a Dadaist collage aesthetic, blending classical oil paintings, American newspaper clippings, stamp illustrations, and photographs to create a dreamcore, absurd, and surreal atmosphere. The text adopts a satirical, humorous tone, teasing the player's actions and offering witty commentary on the falling objects from perspectives ranging from Spielberg films to the Industrial Revolution and consumerism.

Every falling item and every moment of imbalance is a playful jab at the player's endless pursuit of "perfect balance." We constantly try to control and harmonize everything, yet in a world filled with uncertainty and ever-increasing entropy, perfect balance remains an elusive phantom. *Balance or Die* is a philosophical reflection. In the game, players are like someone jesting with fate—fully aware that they can never truly control everything, yet they strive on against the chaos, navigating a makeshift, improvised existence.

## How to Play

Use your mouse to drag objects onto the scale, keep it balanced, and don't let anything fall off.

- Drag falling objects with the mouse.
