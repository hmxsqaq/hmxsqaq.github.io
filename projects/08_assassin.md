## About the Game

> "To poke each other is justice." — The King of "AssAssIn"

In a faraway land, every creature is composed of two parts: a "Stinger" and an "ASS." The "Stinger" is hard and sharp, serving as each creature's unique weapon. The "ASS" is fragile and vulnerable, yet it is the source of power and life. Influenced by this unique anatomy, the land's most grandiose competitive sport evolved: "AssAssIn." Competitors charge wildly in an arena, aiming to use their own "Stinger" to pop their opponent's "ASS"! Every creature strives to become the champion, colliding recklessly while protecting their own "ASS," until they are the last one standing.

Play as a contestant in the great "AssAssIn" tournament. Use unique dashing techniques and the constantly spawning energy orbs to battle opponents across various arenas. Feeling a bit plain? No problem! Customizing your "Stinger" and "ASS" is every contestant's right. Find the build and combat style that suits you, claim victory after victory, and become the King of "AssAssIn"!

*AssAssIn* is a 2D party game centered around a two-player versus mode. Your goal is to pop every "ASS" that stands before you in the virtual arena, even if its owner is sitting right next to you. Hone your "Stinger" to be the sharpest, shield your "ASS" to be impenetrable, and treat every collision as a decisive blow. You are invincible, child.

Of course, if you grow tired of the real-life brawls that follow each match of "AssAssIn," you can try some less aggressive game modes: Soccer Battle, Racing, or Turf War... however, these are all still under development.

**Dash, Collide, Pop, and Conquer!** You're guaranteed an unforgettable and joyful experience in *AssAssIn*.

## Key Features

- **Creative Two-Player Mayhem:** Grab a friend anytime and pop their "ASS" in a virtual world of high-speed dashing. See who the true King of "AssAssIn" is!
- **Simple & Intuitive Controls:** With a maximum of two buttons needed for smooth operation, you can enjoy the purest party game experience at any time. (Note: A controller is currently required for local two-player mode.)
- **Diverse Equipment System:** Choose from a wide variety of "Stingers" and "ASS" parts, each with unique attributes. Mix and match freely to find your favorite combination and achieve victory in your own style.
- **Carefully Designed Arenas:** Every map has its own distinct features. Master the characteristics of each arena to gain a significant advantage in your matches. Only those who know every arena can truly be called the King of "AssAssIn."
