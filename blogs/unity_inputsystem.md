# A First Look at Unity's New Input System

## Introduction

The Input System is Unity's modern solution for handling user input (though it's not that new anymore). My previous understanding of it was superficial at best. This article is a compilation of my learning notes, based on the official documentation and various online resources, on how to use it effectively. I hope you find it helpful. 😉

## Installation and Setup

You can install the package through Unity's built-in **Package Manager** (`Window > Package Manager`). The editor will need to restart after installation.

Next, you must enable the new system. Navigate to `Project Settings > Player > Other Settings`, and under the **Configuration** section, set **Active Input Handling** to either `Input System Package (New)` or `Both`.

## The Core Concept: Actions

{% include projects/image.html src="https://hmxs-1315810738.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/202303292017544.png" %}

**Actions** are arguably the most important concept in the new Input System.

An Action is an abstraction layer that sits between raw user input and your game logic. Unlike the old `Input` class, where your code would check for specific key presses or button states, your code now listens to Actions.

This creates a simple but powerful workflow: `Raw User Input -> Action -> Game Logic`.

By decoupling input from logic, this system makes it much easier to manage controls and add cross-platform or multi-device support. For example, you can bind a gamepad's left stick, a keyboard's `WASD` keys, and even on-screen touch controls to a single `Move` Action. Your movement script then only needs to query the `Move` Action for its current value, without needing to know which device provided the input.

## Creating Actions

There are several ways to create and manage Actions. Here are two of the most common methods.

### 1. Creating a Single Action via Serialization

You can define an `InputAction` directly as a public variable in any `MonoBehaviour` script.

```c#
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.InputSystem;

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public InputAction moveAction;
}
```

After attaching the script to a GameObject, the `moveAction` will appear in the Inspector. You can click the gear icon to configure its properties and use the `+` and `-` buttons to add or remove **Bindings** (e.g., binding the `W` key).

{% include projects/image.html src="https://hmxs-1315810738.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/202303292039605.png" %}

### 2. Managing Actions with an Input Actions Asset

For more complex projects, the recommended approach is to use an **Input Actions Asset**. You can create one by right-clicking in your `Assets` folder and selecting `Create > Input Actions`.

{% include projects/image.html src="https://hmxs-1315810738.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/202303292046474.png" %}

Double-clicking this asset opens a dedicated editor window. Here, you can organize your Actions into **Action Maps**, which are groups of Actions that can be enabled or disabled together (e.g., a "Gameplay" map and a "UI" map).

## Action Properties

{% include projects/image.html src="https://hmxs-1315810738.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/202303292052522.png" %}

Each Action has properties that define how it behaves and what kind of data it outputs.

### Action Type

The **Action Type** determines how an Action interprets input and when it triggers events.

| | **Value** | **Button** | **Pass Through** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **started** | When the value changes from its initial state. | When the button is first pressed. | When any control changes from its initial state. |
| **performed** | Whenever the value changes. | When the button press exceeds the defined threshold. | Whenever the value of any control changes. |
| **canceled** | When the value returns to its initial state. | When the button is released. | When all controls return to their initial state. |

The main difference between `Value` and `Pass Through` is that `Value` picks the single most active control and reports its value, while `Pass Through` processes input from all bound controls simultaneously.

### Interactions

**Interactions** are behaviors that require a specific input pattern to be met before an Action is triggered. For example, you can add a `Hold` Interaction to an Action to make it fire only after a button has been held down for a certain duration.

Other common Interactions include `Tap`, `SlowTap`, and `Press`. For a complete list, see the [Official Documentation on Interactions](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.5/manual/Interactions.html#predefined-interactions).

## Binding Actions to Methods

Once your Actions are set up, you need to connect them to your game logic. This generally involves two steps:
1.  Getting a reference to the Action in your script.
2.  Subscribing a method to the Action's events.

Here are two popular ways to accomplish this.

### Method 1: Using the Player Input Component

The `Player Input` component is a convenient way to manage an Input Actions Asset on a GameObject.

{% include projects/image.html src="https://hmxs-1315810738.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/202303300101984.png" %}

First, add the component to your player GameObject and drag your Input Actions Asset into the `Actions` slot. The component's **Behavior** property offers four ways to trigger methods:

*   **Send Messages**: Calls a method on the same GameObject with a specific name (e.g., `OnMove`, `OnFire`). This is easy to set up but is less performant due to its use of reflection.
*   **Broadcast Messages**: Same as `Send Messages`, but also sends the message to all child GameObjects. This is even less performant.
*   **Invoke Unity Events**: Exposes UnityEvents in the Inspector, just like UI Buttons. You can then assign callbacks visually. This can be tedious for a large number of Actions.
    {% include projects/image.html src="https://hmxs-1315810738.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/202305231927303.png" %}
*   **Invoke C Sharp Events**: Exposes C# events that you can subscribe to from your scripts. This is the most performant and flexible option. You get a reference to the `PlayerInput` component and subscribe to events like `onActionTriggered`.

*Note: You aren't limited to these four behaviors. You can also get a reference to the `PlayerInput` component, access its `actions` property to find a specific Action, and subscribe to its events directly. This approach is very similar to the next method.*

### Method 2: Generating a C# Class

For maximum control and type safety, you can auto-generate a C# wrapper class from your Input Actions Asset.

Select your asset, and in the Inspector, check the box for **Generate C# Class** and click `Apply`.

{% include projects/image.html src="https://hmxs-1315810738.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/img/202305232310377.png" %}

This creates a class that contains direct references to all your Action Maps and Actions. You can then instantiate this class in your script to access your controls.

*Crucially, you must remember to `Enable()` the input actions; otherwise, they won't work!*

Here is an example script:

```c#
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.InputSystem;

public class Test : MonoBehaviour
{
    // IS_Test is the name of the Input Actions Asset and the generated C# class.
    private IS_Test _inputActions;

    private void Awake()
    {
        // Instantiate the generated class.
        _inputActions = new IS_Test();

        // Subscribe a method to the 'performed' event of the 'Move' action 
        // in the 'Games' Action Map.
        _inputActions.Games.Move.performed += OnMove;
    }

    private void OnEnable()
    {
        // Enable the Action Map.
        _inputActions.Games.Enable();
    }

    private void OnDisable()
    {
        // Disable the Action Map to prevent it from running in the background.
        _inputActions.Games.Disable();
    }
    
    // The callback method. Note that its parameter must be of type InputAction.CallbackContext.
    private void OnMove(InputAction.CallbackContext context)
    {
        // Read the value from the context. The type (Vector2) must match what
        // you configured in the Action's properties.
        Debug.Log(context.ReadValue<Vector2>());
    }
}
```
