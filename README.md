This portfolio customizes the default TechFolios template in the following ways:

- **Custom Styling**: Complete redesign of visual aesthetics with custom CSS files:
  - `about.css`: Glass morphism profile picture, info cards, and social icons
  - `blogs.css`: Blog cards with background images and glass overlay effects
  - `projects.css`: Project showcase cards with hover animations
  - `global-background.css`: Site-wide gradient backgrounds
  - `header-footer.css`: Navigation and footer styling

- **Content Organization**: Structured content with templates for consistent formatting:
  - Blog posts with featured images, labels, and summaries
  - Project showcases with images and technology tags
  - "See all" feature for browsing complete collections
